# Report: Data cleaning, tokenization, and naive Bayes classification on the IMDb dataset

## Introduction

In today's digital age, a huge amount of data is generated and collected across different domains. However, raw data often contains noise, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information, so it is essential to preprocess and clean the data before using it for analysis or modeling. This report focuses on the process of data cleaning, tokenization and application of Naive Bayes classification to the IMDb dataset.

## Overview of the IMDb dataset

The IMDb dataset is a popular dataset used for sentiment analysis and text classification tasks. Contains a collection of movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative). The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify the sentiment of a given movie review.

## Data cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data preprocessing process. It includes identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.

In the IMDb dataset, data cleansing steps may include:
1. Removal of HTML tags and special characters from the text.
2. Handling missing values ​​by either imputing them or removing corresponding samples.
3. Removing duplicate reviews to make each review unique.
4. Convert text to lowercase letters to ensure tokenization and parsing consistency.
5. Removal of stop words that do not significantly contribute to sentiment analysis.

## Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of dividing text into smaller units called tokens. In natural language processing (NLP), tokens are typically words or subwords. Tokenization is an essential step before text can be used for analysis or modeling.

In the context of the IMDb dataset:
1. Tokenization involves dividing movie reviews into individual words or sub-words.
2. Punctuation marks and spaces are often used as token boundaries.
3. Tokenization helps convert text data into a structured format that can be used for various NLP tasks.

## Naive Bayes classification

Naive Bayes classification is a probabilistic algorithm commonly used for text classification tasks. It assumes that the presence of a certain element in a class is independent of the presence of other elements, which may not be true in real-world scenarios. Despite this simplifying assumption, however, Naive Bayes often performs surprisingly well in text classification tasks.

Steps for Naive Bayes classification on IMDb dataset:
1. **Feature Extraction**: Convert tokenized text into numeric features using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embedding.
2. **Training**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a Naive Bayes classifier using the training data.
3. **Prediction**: Apply a trained classifier to test data to predict sentiment labels for movie reviews.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Conclusion

Data cleaning and preprocessing are essential steps before applying any machine learning or natural language processing techniques. Tokenization helps convert raw text into a structured format suitable for analysis. Naive Bayes classification, despite its simplifying assumptions, can produce effective results for sentiment analysis tasks on datasets such as IMDb.

The process of data cleaning, tokenization, and Naive Bayes classification on the IMDb dataset demonstrates the importance of these steps in building a robust and accurate sentiment analysis model. However, it is worth noting that while Naive Bayes is a simple and interpretable algorithm, more advanced techniques such as deep learning models could potentially achieve even higher performance at this task.
